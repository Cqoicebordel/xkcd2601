# xkcd2601

This is a project to transcribe xkcd #2601, the April Fools post for 2022, to runnable logo code.

It runs in FMSLogo, which is windows only, sadly. But it might run on your
logo variant of choice.

If you can find a logo that is open source, multi-platform, renderers
beautifully, doesn't require an installer on windows, and runs this code with
a minimum number of changes, i'll happily convert the project over to that.

(I first tried aUCBLogo, which seemed nice, but it started crashing on the
input once there were a certain number of comments, which seemed like a red flag)

To run this in FMSLogo, open the file, then in the console, type **xkcd**.

To open the file for editing in FMSLogo, you press the inscrutable "Edall"
button. You must then save and close your edit before running it again, or
highlight lines in the editor and hit ctrl-R to run them immediately.

Like I said, would love a decent alternative to this logo interpreter.
